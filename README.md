# VirtualCalculator
A virtual calculator using mediapipe and open-source LLMs- (Gemini 1.5 Flash model).

This was an experimental project I worked on, called the Virtual Calculator. Here I use Mediapipe to recognize hand-gestures which allows me to write complex mathematical problems on the screen. I input the same to the Gemini model, which gives me the answer with detailed explaination instantly.

Computer Vision file - contains code for capturing query.
Gemini - contains experimenation with gemini which responds to the query taken above(demonstrated in file.)


Note - Answer may vary based on the clarity with which we input question, and model efficiency.
This project was done to experiment the many use cases of CV and gen AI together.
