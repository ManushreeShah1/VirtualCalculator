# VirtualCalculator
A virtual calculator using mediapipe and open-source LLMs- (Gemini 1.5 Flash model).

This was an experimental project I worked on, called the Virtual Calculator. Here I use Mediapipe to recognize hand-gestures which allows me to write complex mathematical problems on the screen. I input the same to the Gemini model, which gives me the answer with detailed explaination instantly.

Computer Vision file - contains code for capturing query.
Gemini - contains experimenattion with gemini which responds to the query taken above(demonstrated in file.)
